This is a sample plaintext message for testing the Not-so-Simple Substitution Cipher.  
Programming is fun with Python, Java, and C++!  
Cryptography makes secure communication possible.  
HELLO WORLD becomes OLSSV DVYSK with a shift of 7.  
Can you decrypt this message if n = 15?  
The secret password is: ENCRYPTION123.  
Bonus challenge: Implement AdvancedDecrypt() to crack the key!  
The cipher is breakable via frequency analysisâ€”common letters like 'E' leave clues!  
Julius Caesar used a similar cipher (n=3) to protect military messages.  
Adding a brute-force decryption function tests all 25 shifts in <1 second!
